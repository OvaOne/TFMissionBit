        You come to the conclusion that a walk will help calm your mind so you go out into the magic forest. As you are walking the trail you see some litter on the ground and pick it up. It ends up being a loterry ticket. YAY! That night you win the lottery and get billions of dollars. BUT after tax you only get $10. Sucks for you.
