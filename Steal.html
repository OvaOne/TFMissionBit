    <font size="60"><p><mark>You have decided the best course of action is to go to a bank and steal money. You find an underground trail into the vault and you use it. Before you can escape the tunnel collapses and you are stuck in the vault. You scream for help but no one hears you so you slowly die from lack of oxygen. Your body is discovered a week later. DONT STEAL!!!!</mark></p> </font>
